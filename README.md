# leetcode
This repository contains solutions to some of the problems on leetcode solved by me

For a few problems, I have added a randtestcase.py file to generate random test cases in a tmp.txt file which can be directly copy pasted to leetcode's custom testcase box and you can run and check if your answer matches with the expected answer.
Just run the randtestcase.py file and a text file tmp.txt will be created/overwritten if alredy present.
Most are solved in Java, some in Python3 and some in both.
